Introduction 
=============

Spanish Public Administrations' websites must have a 
so called "Contractors profile" in which the Administration
must publish all information about the different contracts 
and its assignation procedure: public notice of it, the document
with the contract grant, the signature of the contract, ...

Each Administration wants to change the way to show this
information: PDF files, HTML text-fields, ... so we tried to
create the most generic product as possible and then let each
project change it.
